# Unscramble Computer Science Problems

## Project Overview

In this project, you will complete five tasks based on a fabricated set of
calls and texts exchanged during September 2016. You will use Python to analyze
and answer questions about the texts and calls contained in the dataset. Lastly,
you will perform run time analysis of your solution and determine its efficiency.

## Tasks

### Task 0

What is the first record of texts and what is the last record of calls?

### Task 1

How many different telephone numbers are there in the records?

### Task 2

Which telephone number spent the longest time on the phone during the period?
Don't forget that time spent answering a call is also time spent on the phone.

### Task 3

Part A: Find all of the area codes and mobile prefixes called by people
in Bangalore. In other words, the calls were initiated by "(080)" area code
to the following area codes and mobile prefixes:
 - Fixed lines start with an area code enclosed in brackets. The area
   codes vary in length but always begin with 0.
 - Mobile numbers have no parentheses, but have a space in the middle
   of the number to help readability. The prefix of a mobile number
   is its first four digits, and they always start with 7, 8 or 9.
 - Telemarketers' numbers have no parentheses or space, but they start
   with the area code 140.

Part B: What percentage of calls from fixed lines in Bangalore are made
to fixed lines also in Bangalore? In other words, of all the calls made
from a number starting with "(080)", what percentage of these calls
were made to a number also starting with "(080)"?

### Task 4

The telephone company want to identify numbers that might be doing telephone
marketing. Create a set of possible telemarketers: these are numbers that make
outgoing calls but never send texts, receive texts or receive incoming calls.
